📘 EpiTech: Developing Epilepsy Care with Implantable Device

This repository contains all the deliverables and documentation for the EpiTech project, developed as part of our Informatics Project Management course. The project involved designing and managing the development of an implantable medical device for real-time epilepsy seizure detection using machine learning.

🧠 Project Overview

The goal was to create a prototype for a smart implantable device capable of continuous brain activity monitoring, seizure detection, and alert notification to caregivers and medical professionals. This project also focused on cost control, risk management, stakeholder communication, and ethical considerations.

🛠️ Tools & Artifacts Used
